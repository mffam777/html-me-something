  <h2>Departure date</h2>

  <p>On July 18, 2018, at 4:00 AM in the morning my family and I when on a trip to visit Niagara Falls Park in New York. The trip experiences were one of the best family vacations ever. We did not spend much time planning the trip as we usually do before any major family vacation trip. The vacation trip was an impromptu decision made at the dinner table.</p>

  <h4>Preparing for the trip</h4>
  
  <h2>Planning</h2>

  <p>I was little apprehensive about the lack of planning and the short time frame set to depart. However, with a shortage of time to execute all need it step prior the trip the entire family pushes forward to make the trip possible. The excitement of the trip overwhelmed us with enthusiasm and wonder. Surprisingly; all step requires prior the trip was accomplished in a timely manner:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Passport update</li>
      
    <li>Trip logistic:</li>

      <ul>

        <li>Lodging</li>
        <li>Route selection</li>
        <li>Refueling poin</li>
        <li>Rest stop</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Precautionary action with:</li>

        <li>Bank notification</li>
        <li>Mobile phone coverage</li>
        <li>State Department notification</li>
      </ul>

  </ol>

  <p>While going through the trip preparation; the trip idea filled like a surreal as things fall in place so quickly. In
  particular, the renewing of the passport, that we much need it to cross the border and explore the Niagara Falls in the
  Canadian side.</p>

  <h2>Resting Areas</h2>
  
  <p>We made several stops through the trip but two of the resting area that we like the most were:</p>

    <li>Montgomery Pike Scenic Overlook; Montgomery; PA</li>
  
  </ul>

  <h4>Montgomery Pike Scenic Overlook; Montgomery; PA</h4>

  <p>Montgomery Pike Scenic Overlook in Montgomery, Pennsylvania, provide a scenic view that reach out to Williamsport, PA.

  <h4>View of the Rainbow Bridge, crossing point to Canada</h4>

  <p>There is different amenity at the Niagara Falls, but the one we enjoy the most was the Maid of the Mist boat tour. It is a short boat tour that takes you to a enclose encounter with the majesty of the falls.</p>

  <h4>Panoramic view of the Niagara Falls from the Rainbow Bridge</h4>

  <p>Our family three date vacation in the Niagara Falls was one full of excitement and adventure. The Niagara Falls
  experience created lasting vivid memories. The scenic view of this park is captivating and mesmerizing. The only regret
  we have is that we should book the hotel for a longer stay. There so much to see at this place that it will take as a
  minimum a week to visit each attraction on both sides.</p>
